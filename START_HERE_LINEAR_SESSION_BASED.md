# 📚 Session-Based Linear Integration Package

## Your Complete Linear MCP Setup - Optimized for Real Work

You were absolutely right - creating Linear issues for everything during development is excessive. This package implements a **session-based approach** where Linear issues are created only when they matter: at commit time for incomplete work and at session end for work that continues.

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Linear tracks work CONTINUITY, not work HISTORY**

- ✅ Create issues for: Work spanning multiple sessions
- ❌ Don't create issues for: Work completed in same session
- 📝 PROJECT_STATUS.md: Today's scratchpad
- 🔗 Linear: Tomorrow's starting point

**Your main implementation file**
- Copy-paste script for Claude Code
- Sets up LINEAR_CONFIG.md with session-based rules
- Configures git integration
- Establishes commit workflows

### 2. [💡 Philosophy & Best Practices](computer:///home/claude/LINEAR_SESSION_PHILOSOPHY.md)
**Why this approach works better**
- Problem with real-time issue creation
- Benefits of session-based tracking
- Practical examples and patterns
- Decision trees for issue creation

### 3. [⚡ Quick Reference Card](computer:///home/claude/LINEAR_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
**Daily cheat sheet**
- Essential commands
- What gets an issue vs what doesn't
- Daily workflow
- Common mistakes to avoid

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes)

1. **Copy the entire [Setup Guide](computer:///home/claude/LINEAR_MCP_SESSION_BASED.md)**
2. **Paste into Claude Code** for your project
3. **Answer Claude's questions**:
   - Confirm team name (PERNELL)
   - Confirm project label format
4. **Claude will**:
   - Create LINEAR_CONFIG.md with session-based rules
   - Update your existing files
   - Check for existing issues
   - Report findings WITHOUT creating unnecessary issues

---

## 🎨 Your Optimized Workflow

### Morning
```
"What Linear issues are assigned to me?"
→ Continue existing work OR start fresh
```

### During Day
```
Find bug → Fix it → Commit (no issue)
Find TODO → Add comment (no issue)
Can't finish feature → Note in PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

### End of Day
```
"What needs a Linear issue for tomorrow?"
→ Create issues ONLY for continuing work
→ Commit with [PT-XXX] reference
```

## 📊 Why This Works for 20+ Projects

### Without This Approach
- 20 projects × 50 micro-issues = 1000 issues to manage
- Constant context switching
- Linear becomes noise

### With This Approach  
- 20 projects × 3 real issues = 60 meaningful issues
- Clear priorities
- Linear becomes useful

---

## 🏷️ Your Label System (Already Set Up)

```
project:playwright-extensions
project:app-2
project:app-3
... one per project

+ priority:high/medium/low
+ Bug/Feature/tech-debt
+ Component labels
```

Perfect for filtering without project switching!

---

## ✅ Key Benefits

1. **Less Interruption** - No constant Linear updates
2. **Clean Workspace** - Only meaningful issues  
3. **Better Metrics** - Issues represent real work units
4. **Scales to 20+ Projects** - Manageable issue count
5. **Natural Workflow** - Fits how you actually work

---

## 💬 The One Rule

Before creating any Linear issue, ask:

> **"Will I need to remember this for my next work session?"**

- YES → Create Linear issue
- NO → Don't create issue

---

## 🔧 Customization

Adjust these triggers based on your preference:

### Minimal (Your Current Preference)
- Only create issues at commit/session end
- Only for multi-session work
- Everything else stays in code/notes

### Moderate
- Add issues for blockers immediately
- Track important refactoring
- Still skip minor TODOs

### Detailed (If Needed)
- Track daily work
- Include investigation tasks
- Still skip micro-issues

## 🚦 Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ Linear has 5-10 issues per project, not 50-100
- ✅ Every issue in Linear actually matters
- ✅ You spend more time coding than managing issues
- ✅ SESSION_STATUS.md is your daily companion
- ✅ Linear is your session handoff tool

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. **Pick a project** (playwright-extensions is perfect)
2. **Copy the [Setup Guide](computer:///home/claude/LINEAR_MCP_SESSION_BASED.md)**
3. **Paste into Claude Code**
4. **Start working normally**
5. **Only create issues at natural boundaries**

---

## 💡 Remember

This approach respects that:
- Not every thought needs tracking
- Most code issues get fixed immediately  
- Linear should help, not hinder
- Your time is valuable
- Less tracking can mean more productivity

**Your instinct was correct: Automatic issue creation during development IS excessive.**

This session-based approach gives you the benefits of Linear's organization without the overhead of constant issue management.
