## In Progress üöß
- [ ] Testing build compilation
- [ ] Verifying all Swift files compile correctly
- [ ] Ensuring proper navigation flow

## Pending/Backlog üìã
- [ ] QR code scanning for team codes
- [ ] Map integration for directions
- [ ] Actual Supabase connection (needs credentials)
- [ ] Push notification registration with APNS
- [ ] App icon and launch screen
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] UI tests
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Multiple team support (for families with multiple children)

## Known Issues üêõ
- Supabase credentials not configured (using environment variables)
- QR code scanner view not implemented (placeholder button)
- Map directions shows placeholder view
- No actual network calls (demo mode only)

## Recent Decisions üìù
- Using SwiftData for local persistence instead of Core Data
- Implemented demo team with code "DEMO01" for testing
- Read-only views throughout (no editing capabilities)
- Using 6-character alphanumeric team codes
- No user authentication required (team codes only)

## Next Session Goals
1. Build and run the app in Xcode
2. Test the onboarding flow with demo team
3. Verify navigation between all tabs
4. Test SwiftData persistence
5. Begin implementing QR code scanning
6. Add proper error handling throughout
