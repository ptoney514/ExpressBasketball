## üéØ Next Session Goals - Coach App Integration

### Goal: Enable coaches to send push notifications to parents from ExpressCoach app

### Step 1: Database Schema (30 mins)
**Create `device_tokens` table in Supabase**

```sql
CREATE TABLE device_tokens (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    team_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES teams(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    device_token TEXT NOT NULL,
    platform TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ios',
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(device_token, team_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_device_tokens_team_id ON device_tokens(team_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_device_tokens_active ON device_tokens(is_active) WHERE is_active = true;
```

**Add to ExpressUnited (parent app):**
- On app launch with team joined ‚Üí register device token
- On team leave ‚Üí deactivate device token
- Update token if changed

### Step 2: Update ExpressCoach SupabaseService (30 mins)
**Add method to send push notifications:**

```swift
func sendPushNotification(
    teamId: UUID,
    title: String,
    body: String,
    type: String,
    badge: Int? = nil
) async throws {
    // Call Supabase Edge Function
    // Pass team_id to get all device tokens
    // Function queries device_tokens table
    // Sends to all active tokens for that team
}
```

### Step 3: Update Coach App UI (45 mins)
**Add notification sending to these views:**

1. **AnnouncementsView**
   - Add toggle: "Send Push Notification" (default: ON)
   - When creating announcement ‚Üí auto-send push if enabled

2. **ScheduleView**
   - Add toggle: "Send Notification" when creating/editing
   - Schedule change ‚Üí auto-send push notification

3. **Notification Composer (Optional)**
   - Dedicated view to send custom notifications
   - Preview before sending
   - Select notification type

### Step 4: Test End-to-End Flow (30 mins)
1. Coach creates announcement in ExpressCoach
2. Verify push sent via Supabase logs
3. Parent receives notification on iPhone
4. Tap notification ‚Üí opens to Messages tab
5. Verify announcement appears
