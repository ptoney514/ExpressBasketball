## Pending/Backlog üìã

### Quick Wins (Can be done in 1-2 days each)
1. **Demo Mode with SwiftData** - Ready to activate
2. **Local Team & Roster Management** - Models ready, needs UI binding
3. **Schedule & Event Management** - Views built, needs data operations
4. **Announcements System** - Local storage ready
5. **Team Code System** - Simple implementation possible

### Immediate Priority (After Sprint)
1. **Supabase Backend Setup**
   - Create Supabase project
   - Set up database tables (teams, players, schedules, etc.)
   - Configure row-level security
   - Add demo data

2. **Team Code System**
   - Implement 6-character team code generation
   - Add team code entry view for ExpressUnited
   - QR code scanning capability

3. **Demo Profile System**
   - Create demo profiles for instant app demonstration
   - Profile switching in settings
   - Pre-populated demo data

### Next Priority
4. **ExpressBasketballCore Package**
   - Create shared Swift package
   - Move common models to shared package
   - Implement shared services (Supabase, Notifications)

5. **ExpressUnited Implementation**
   - Build parent app UI
   - Read-only views for schedules, roster, announcements
   - Connect to Supabase for data

6. **Data Synchronization**
   - Real-time sync between apps
   - Offline support with SwiftData caching
   - Conflict resolution

## Known Issues üêõ

1. **Bundle Identifier**: Currently using placeholder `com.yourcompany.ExpressCoach` - needs to be updated before deployment
2. **Deployment Target**: ExpressUnited shows inconsistency (17.0 vs 17.6) - needs alignment
3. **Supabase Connection**: SDK integrated but no API keys or configuration present

## Recent Decisions üìù

1. **Two-App Architecture**: Separate apps for parents and coaches to eliminate role-switching complexity
2. **No Authentication Initially**: Using team codes instead of user accounts for simpler onboarding
3. **SwiftData for Local Storage**: Chosen for offline-first capability and iOS 17+ integration
4. **Demo Mode First**: Building demo functionality before real data to enable instant app demonstrations

## Technical Debt üí≥

- No error handling implemented yet
- No unit tests written
- Supabase service layer not abstracted
- Hard-coded values in views need to be extracted to constants

## Next Session Goals

1. Complete project setup documentation (WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)
2. Create Supabase project and database schema
3. Configure Supabase connection in ExpressCoach app
4. Begin implementing team code entry system

## Environment Setup Notes

### Required Tools
- Xcode 15.0+ installed ‚úÖ
- Supabase CLI (needs installation)
- iOS Simulator configured ‚úÖ

### Configuration Needed
- Supabase project creation
- APNS certificates for push notifications
- App Store Connect setup (future)

## Development Metrics

- **ExpressCoach Progress**: ~25% of Phase 1 complete
- **ExpressUnited Progress**: ~5% of Phase 1 complete
- **Backend Setup**: 0% complete
- **Documentation**: 70% complete
