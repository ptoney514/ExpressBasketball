# AI Communication Hub - Redesign Documentation

## Overview
The AI Assistant Coach page has been redesigned to prioritize communication as the primary feature, transforming it into a powerful messaging hub where coaches can quickly compose and send messages with AI assistance.

## Key Features

### 1. Modern Messaging Interface
- **Chat-style input field** at the bottom of the screen for natural message composition
- **Voice input capability** with animated recording indicator
- **Real-time message preview** before sending
- **Dark theme aesthetic** for professional appearance

### 2. AI-Powered Message Composition
Coaches can type or dictate natural language commands such as:
- "notify all parents practice is cancelled"
- "Game time for Express 15 U is moved to 5:30 PM, let all players and parents know"
- "Send tournament info to all families"

The AI then:
1. Interprets the intent
2. Generates a professional, well-structured message

4. Presents it for review before sending

### 3. Quick Actions
Pre-configured templates for common scenarios:
- Practice Cancelled
- Game Time Change
- Weather Delay
- Tournament Info
- Urgent Update
- Team Meeting

Each quick action automatically:
- Pre-fills message template
- Selects appropriate recipients
- Allows customization before sending

### 4. Smart Recipient Selection
- **Recipient groups**: All Parents, All Players, All Staff, Specific Teams, Individuals
- **Visual chips** showing selected recipients
- **Auto-selection** based on message context
- **Color-coded** recipient badges for clarity

### 5. Recent Communications History
- Shows recent messages with delivery status
- Visual indicators for:
  - Sent messages
