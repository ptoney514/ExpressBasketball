# Audio Recording Thread Safety Fix

## Problem
The ExpressCoach app was experiencing thread safety crashes when users tapped the AI microphone button in the ChatView. The crash manifested as "Thread 10: abort with payload or reason" related to audio recording operations.

## Root Causes
1. AVAudioSession operations were happening on different threads without proper synchronization
2. UI properties were being updated from background threads without main thread dispatch
3. The Timer for audio level monitoring was not properly managed for thread safety
4. The AudioRecorderManager class lacked proper actor isolation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Main Actor Isolation
- Added `@MainActor` annotation to the entire `AudioRecorderManager` class
- This ensures all properties and methods execute on the main thread by default
- Prevents race conditions when accessing audio recorder state

### 2. Simplified Thread Management
- Removed unnecessary async/await operations that were causing thread confusion
- All AVAudioRecorder operations now happen on the main thread
- Removed the recording queue for audio operations since AVAudioRecorder is already thread-safe internally

### 3. Proper Timer Management
- Timer creation and invalidation now happens exclusively on the main thread
- Added weak self capture in Timer closure to prevent retain cycles
- Timer properly cleaned up in both stopRecording and deinit

### 4. Improved Cleanup
- Added proper cleanup in deinit that doesn't violate actor isolation
- Ensures resources are properly released even if the view is dismissed unexpectedly

### 5. Audio Session Configuration
- Fixed deprecated API usage (allowBluetooth -> allowBluetoothA2DP)
- Simplified audio session setup to run on main thread
- Added proper error handling for permission requests

## Key Changes Made

### AudioRecorderManager Class Structure
```swift
@MainActor
class AudioRecorderManager: NSObject, ObservableObject {
    // All properties and methods are now main actor isolated
    @Published var isRecording = false
    @Published var audioLevel: Float = 0.0
    
    // Proper cleanup in deinit without violating actor isolation
    deinit {
        levelTimer?.invalidate()
        // Stop recording on background queue if needed
    }
}
```

### Thread-Safe Recording
- Recording starts on main thread
- Audio level monitoring uses proper weak self capture
- All UI updates guaranteed to happen on main thread

### Delegate Methods
- Marked delegate methods as `nonisolated` 
- Use Task { @MainActor in } to call main actor methods from delegates

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Recording Test**
   - Tap the AI microphone button
   - Verify recording starts without crashes
   - Check that audio levels animate properly

2. **Rapid Start/Stop Test**
   - Quickly tap start and stop recording multiple times
   - Verify no crashes or thread conflicts

3. **Background/Foreground Test**
   - Start recording
   - Send app to background
   - Return to foreground
   - Verify recording state is properly handled

4. **Memory Test**
   - Record multiple times in succession
   - Monitor for memory leaks
   - Verify proper cleanup after each recording
