## üí° Pro Testing Tips

### Test Edge Cases
1. **Airplane Mode**: Turn on airplane mode, have coach send notification, turn off airplane mode - does it arrive?
2. **Battery Saver**: Enable Low Power Mode - do notifications still arrive?
3. **App Closed**: Force-quit ExpressUnited - do notifications wake it up?
4. **Multiple Notifications**: Have coach send 3 announcements quickly - do all arrive?

### Test Real-World Scenarios
1. **During Practice**: Have coach update schedule during actual practice
2. **Late Night**: Send notification at 10pm - is it too disruptive?
3. **Multiple Teams**: Join 2 demo teams - do notifications work for both?

### Test Permissions
1. **Denied Permissions**: Deny notification permission during onboarding - can you re-enable later?
2. **Settings App**: Disable notifications in iOS Settings - does app handle gracefully?
